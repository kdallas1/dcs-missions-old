**Horus Campaign**

**Goal:** Capture the northern Azmenistan Liberation Front-occupied territory.

**Mission 1**

*Take out the early warning radar (EWR) systems in the mountains so we can proceed.*

The enemy has taken over the North-East territory. Intelligence reports that those dirty bastards have installed an EWRS somewhere in the mountains between Sukhumi and Nalchik, North-East of our position. Well, actually, due North for the guy who can't fly an F-18, if he even shows up. The exact location of the target is not yet known because our Intelligence unit is being super lazy, and they haven't come back from lunch yet.

Your mission is to take out the EWRS by any means necessary. You're loaded up with air-to-ground munitions, and some air-to-air as we are expecting company in the skies above the target. Losing the EWRS will put the enemy at a significant disadvantage, so they'll be pretty pissed if you blow it up. So let's blow it up.

**Mission 2**

*Assist with the rescue of hostages from a terrorist-captured civilian aircraft in enemy territory.*

Your mission is to rendezvous with Georgian 4L-TGG (Fig 1) at waypoint 1, and escort it to the disused airbase at Nalchik (waypoint 2). Georgian 4L-TGG is travelling at 300 knots, 10000 feet above sea level. Navy SEALs are inbound in a C-17A (Colt 1-1) to rescue the civilians and transport them to safety.

We are expecting Azmenistan ground forces to show up shortly after Georgian 4L-TGG lands, so we've equipped you with three Mk-84 bombs to protect the airbase. In the event that Azmenistan aircraft also show up, you also have two AIM-120 AMRAAM and two AIM-9M Sidewinders.

Surveillance drones have supplied aerial photography of the disused airbase (Fig 2). We have marked potential enemy ground ingress routes (S1, N1, and E1). Major Tom will update you with an Intelligence report on enemy movements once airborne.

It is important that you stay airborne until Colt 1-1 is safely away with the hostages. You have two fuel pods onboard, so that should be enough to stay airborne. Colt 1-1 will leave some ground units behind, so once they're away, you can land safely at Nalchik.

Get airborne and head north to waypoint 1, then make sure Georgian 4L-TGG lands at waypoint 2.

**Mission 3**

*Protect inbound transports to Nalchik from enemy air units incoming from all directions.*

No brief.

**Mission 4**

*Assist rescue of downed recon pilots near Beslan and protect against incoming enemy units.*

Protect the two extraction helos heading into Fahrn (south of the river at Beslan). Ensure that our helps get out alive.

Our helos are already enroute, so rendezvous with them at waypoint 1, then proceed to the extraction site at waypoint 2.

Beware of enemy Tunguska SAMs at Beslan.

Attack inbound targets: 
A: 2 x Enemy helos,
B: 2 x Enemy light ground units

**Mission 5**

*Sneak-attack on Beslan; protect choppers carrying commandos who will plant explosives.*

Take out the two Tunguskas at Beslan (WP1). Once the SAMs are down, our commandos will advance to plant C4 at Beslan. 

Once the commandos are in, sit back and watch the show. The enemy base will light up like the 4th of July.

There are reports of AAA in the area around Beslan, so be vigilant. The AAA appears to be idle, for now...

**Mission 6**

*Disrupt enemy attack on Nalchik and Beslan by destroying four enemy FOBs.*

No brief.

**Mission 7**

*Capture Mozdok; destroy enemy aircraft before they can take off, then protect reinforcements.*

No brief.

**Mission 8**

*Assist missile launcher assault on Mineralnye Vody, taking out SAMs.*

No brief.

**Mission 9**

*Final assault on the ALF, capture Mineralnye Vody.*

No brief.
