Good morning you silly idiots.

The enemy has taken over the North-East territory. Intelligence reports that those dirty bastards have installed an EWRS somewhere in the mountains between Sukhumi and Nalchik, North-East of our position. Well, actually, due North for the guy who can't fly an F-18, if he even shows up. The exact location of the target is not yet known because our Intelligence unit is being super lazy, and they haven't come back from lunch yet.

Your mission is to take out the EWRS by any means necessary. You're loaded up with air-to-ground munitions, and some air-to-air as we are expecting company in the skies above the target. Losing the EWRS will put the enemy at a significant disadvantage, so they'll be pretty pissed if you blow it up. So let's blow it up.

Good luck chaps, and try not to fuck it up this time.
