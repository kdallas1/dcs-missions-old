**1. Situation**

Dodge squadron, this is Command. Pay attention and stop screwing around.

Terrorists have captured a civilian Yak-40 aircraft. There are reports of hostages onboard. The aircraft is currently above enemy territory to the north east, which means it's our problem.

We intercepted this transmission: [In Arabic: We have successfully captured the aircraft in the name of Allah. Now the infidels will see that Islam is the only true way of life. Allah will show no mercy on them.]

A friendly rescue team is being assembled at Kutaisi. Your mission is to escort the rescue team, and ensure their safe return.

Get airborne prompto. More details en route. 

Good luck. You'll need it.

**2. Objective**

Dodge squadron, Command here with an update. Listen up.

AWACS reports that the terrorist controlled Yak-40 is now landing at Nal'chik, within enemy Azmenistan territory. Intelligence tells us that General Kamarov has allied with the terrorist faction, and is offering his support to the terrorist's cause. It's likely Kamarov will send units to the airfield in order to prevent any rescue mission.

General Kamarov: [We feel sympathy toward our Lyrobian brothers. You American pig dogs would never understand the suffering.]

Thanks to the heroic actions of Captain Scott... congratulations on your promotion, by the way... the enemy EWRS en-route has been eliminated. This means that the enemy are now blind, and are unlikely to see us coming. However, Kamarov will likely anticipate our arrival, so expect resistance at Nal'chik.

The CSAR rescue team has departed from Kutaisi in a C-17A and is en-route to Nal'chik. We cannot afford for Kamarov to take down that aircraft.

**3. Terrorists**

Dodge squadron, got an update for you.

The Lyrobian terrorists have landed at Nal'chik and have issued their demands.

This transmission was received: [In Arabic: We will kill the hostages unless we receive ten million dollars!]

Our satellite surveillance reports that Kamarov's forces have deployed two SAMs and four tanks at Nal'chik. We are not detecting any airborne threats at this time. It looks like they threw all their MiGs at us during the EWRS mission. Take out the SAMs and tanks before the C-17A arrives.

**4. Intercept**

Dodge squadron, incoming air threat detected. 

Protect the C-17A until that bird is on the ground.

Let's give Kamarov one last middle finger.

**5. Rescue**

Dodge squadron, update incoming.

Good job getting the C-17A on the ground. Those terrorists don't stand a chance against the CSAR team. Stay tuned for updates.

[In Arabic: The infidels have arrived! Kill the hostages!]

[Rescue team chatter]

[Hostages rescued]

Ok, CSAR have the hostages and the C-17A is now departing back to Kutaisi. The CSAR team left some protection behind, so the airbase is ours for now. Your fuel will be pretty low now, so land at Nal'chik and refuel with the help of the new ground crew.

**6. Success**

Dodge squadron, good work. Our C-17A is airborne and en route back to Kutaisi with the hostages. 

You can land now if you want, but it doesn't really matter.

Mission accomplished.

General Kamarov: [We will avenge our Lyrobian brothers. You have not heard the last of the Azmenistan Liberation Front]

[Mission accomplished]

[Battle control terminated]

**7. Failed**

Our C-17A has been destroyed. The terrorists have claimed this as a victory.

[Mission failed]

[Battle control terminated]
