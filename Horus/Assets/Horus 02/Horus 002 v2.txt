**1. Situation** (Voice: Sanders)

Dodge Squadron: Welcome to your briefing room for the day. 

My name is Lieutenant Colonel Sanders (no relation). I'll be briefing you before take off. 

Terrorists have captured civilian aircraft Georgian 4L-TGG. There are reports of hostages onboard and they're very low on fuel.

Go ahead and open up your brief dossier.

**2. Objective** (Voice: Sanders)

Your mission is to rendezvous with Georgian 4L-TGG (Fig 1) at waypoint 1, and escort it to the disused airbase at Nalchik (waypoint 2). Georgian 4L-TGG is travelling at 300 knots, 10000 feet above sea level. Navy SEALs are inbound in a C-17A (Colt 1-1) to rescue the civilians and transport them to safety.

We are expecting Azmenistan ground forces to show up shortly after Georgian 4L-TGG lands, so we've equipped you with three Mk-84 bombs to protect the airbase. In the event that Azmenistan aircraft also show up, you also have two AIM-120 AMRAAM and two AIM-9M Sidewinders.

Surveillance drones have supplied aerial photography of the disused airbase (Fig 2). We have marked potential enemy ground ingress routes (S1, N1, and E1). Major Tom will update you with an Intelligence report on enemy movements once airborne.

It is important that you stay airborne until Colt 1-1 is safely away with the hostages. You have two fuel pods onboard, so that should be enough to stay airborne. Colt 1-1 will leave some ground units behind, so once they're away, you can land safely at Nalchik.

Get airborne and head north to waypoint 1, then make sure Georgian 4L-TGG lands at waypoint 2.

Good luck. 

**3. Rendezvous** (Voice: Major)

Dodge Squadron: This is Major Tom from the Intelligence unit.

We see you've rendezvoused with Terrorist-controlled civilian aircraft, Georgian 4L-TGG. You now need to radio them. 

Order the terrorists to land at Nalchik (waypoint 2). Tell them the Negotiator will give them what they want once they've landed.

Do not attack Georgian 4L-TGG, hostages are onboard.

Over.

**4. Radio** (Voice: Pilot A)

[Dodge Squadron: Georgian 4L-TGG, do you copy?]

[Georgian 4L-TGG: We have taken this plane in name of Allah. You must give us one million dollars.]

[Dodge Squadron: Georgian 4L-TGG, this is the military jet visible outside of your aircraft. We will escort you to Nalchik. Here you will meet the Negotiator, they will give you what you want. Proceed to Nalchik airbase immediately.]

**5. SEALs** (Voice: Pilot B)

Dodge Squadron: This is Colt 1-1. We see that Georgian 4L-TGG is now landing at Nalchik.

Proceeding to land at Nalchik to deploy SEALs. Over.

**6. Kamarov** (Voice: Russian)

[General Kamarov: How dare you invade our territory. The Azmenistan Liberation Front will not stand any aggression toward it's people! Prepare to die.]

**7. Update** (Voice: Major)

Dodge Squadron: Major Tom here with an intelligence update.

Nice work getting that C-17A on the ground. Once they're parked, they'll pop blue and green smoke to indicate friendlies.

Enemy Azmenistan APCs are inbound from the southern ingress point (marked S1 on Fig 2 in your brief).

Take out those APCs before they get to the C-17A. Enemy ETA to airbase is 5 minutes.

Out.

**8. Rescue** (Voice: [None])

[*In Arabic:* The infidels have arrived! Kill the hostages!]

[Rescue team chatter]

[Hostages rescued]

**9. Intercept** (Voice: Major)

Dodge Squadron: Further intelligence for you.

Ok, our C-17A is now airborne, good job. However, you've got inbound enemy air threats from Beslan in the east.

Looks like Azmenistan MiG-23s on an intercept course with our C-17A, ETA 5 minutes.

Take out those MiGs and make sure the C-17A gets away.

Out.

**10. Success** (Voice: Major & Russian)

Dodge squadron: Our C-17A is away safely. Mission accomplished.

[General Kamarov: We will avenge our fallen comrades. You have not heard the last of the Azmenistan Liberation Front!]

[Mission accomplished]

[Battle control terminated]

**11. Failed** (Voice: Major)

Dodge squadron: Our C-17A has been destroyed. The terrorists have claimed this as a victory.

[Terrorists celebrating in the streets]

[Mission failed]

[Battle control terminated]
