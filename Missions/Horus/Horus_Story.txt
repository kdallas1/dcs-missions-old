**Horus Campaign**

**Goal:** Capture the northern ALF (Azmenistan Liberation Front) occupied territory.

**Mission 1**

*Take out the early warning radar (EWR) systems in the mountains.*

The ALF (Azmenistan Liberation Front) has taken over the North-East territory. Intelligence reports that the enemy has installed 3 EWR sites in the mountains between Sukhumi and Nalchik, North-East of our position (WP1-3).

Your mission is to take out the EWR sites. Also, watch out for Stingers on the ground. You're loaded up with air-to-ground munitions, and some air-to-air as we are expecting company in the skies above the target.

**Mission 2**

*Assist with a hostage rescue in enemy territory.*

Your mission is to rendezvous with Georgian 4L-TGG (Fig 1) at waypoint 1, and escort it to the disused airbase at Nalchik (waypoint 2). Georgian 4L-TGG is travelling at 300 knots, 10000 feet above sea level. Navy SEALs are inbound in a C-17A (Colt 1-1) to rescue the civilians and transport them to safety.

We are expecting Azmenistan ground forces to show up shortly after Georgian 4L-TGG lands, so we've equipped you with three Mk-84 bombs to protect the airbase. In the event that Azmenistan aircraft also show up, you also have two AIM-120 AMRAAM and two AIM-9M Sidewinders.

Surveillance drones have supplied aerial photography of the disused airbase (Fig 2). We have marked potential enemy ground ingress routes (S1, N1, and E1). Major Tom will update you with an Intelligence report on enemy movements once airborne.

It is important that you stay airborne until Colt 1-1 is safely away with the hostages. You have two fuel pods onboard, so that should be enough to stay airborne. Colt 1-1 will leave some ground units behind, so once they're away, you can land safely at Nalchik.

Get airborne and head north to waypoint 1, then make sure Georgian 4L-TGG lands at waypoint 2.

**Mission 3**

*Protect inbound transports to Nalchik from enemy air units incoming from all directions.*

After a recent hostage rescue mission, we discovered that Nalchik was disused. Capturing this airbase and establishing a command outpost will give us a tactical advantage toward defeating ALF (Azmenistan Liberation Front) forces in the north region.

Our transports are inbound from the south to provide equipment for the base, but the ALF don't want this to happen. Protect the incoming transports and ensure that they land safely at Nalchik.

**Mission 4**

*Assist rescue of downed recon pilots near Beslan and protect against incoming enemy units.*

Protect the two extraction helos heading into Fahrn (south of the river at Beslan). Ensure that our helps get out alive.

Our helos are already enroute, so rendezvous with them at waypoint 1, then proceed to the extraction site at waypoint 2.

Beware of enemy Tunguska SAMs at Beslan.

Attack inbound targets: 
A: 2 x Enemy helos,
B: 2 x Enemy light ground units

**Mission 5**

*Sneak-attack on Beslan; protect choppers carrying commandos who will plant explosives.*

Take out the two Tunguskas at Beslan (WP1). Once the SAMs are down, our commandos will advance to plant C4 at Beslan. 

Once the commandos are in, sit back and watch the show. The enemy base will light up like the 4th of July.

There are reports of AAA in the area around Beslan, so be vigilant. The AAA appears to be idle, for now...

**Mission 6**

*Disrupt enemy attack on Nalchik and Beslan by destroying four enemy FOBs.*

The enemy has established four FOBs outside our newly occupied bases, Nalchik and Beslan. Both FOBs are situated to the north. The enemy has a substantial armory of tanks and choppers, but they have one weakness: if we take out their command centers (Fig 1) at each FOB, they won't be able to coordinate reinforcements and our forces will overwhelm them.

However, our base also has the same weakness. If our command center is destroyed, then we'll risk losing the base and our reinforcements. Attack the four enemy command centers at each FOB, and ensure that our Nalchik and Beslan command centers are not destroyed by the enemy.

**Mission 7**

*Capture Mozdok; destroy enemy aircraft before they can take off, then protect reinforcements.*

We have discovered a large number of enemy Mirage 2000-5 jets at Mozdok. However, their EWR is offline, so if we attack now, they won't see us coming. Head to Mozdok (WP1) and take out the enemy jets while they're on the ground. Make sure they don't take off, or you'll have a lot of angry ALF fighters to deal with.

**Mission 8**

*Assist missile launcher assault on Mineralnye Vody, taking out SAMs.*

Mineralnye Vody is the ALF's last stronghold, but it is protected by a large number of deadly Buk SAMs (20nm lethal range), too high risk for our current A2G munitions. To take out the enemy SAMs, friendly forces have positioned MLRS M270 rocket launchers at 4 points south east of the enemy base.

Enemy jets have been scrambled to destroy our rocket launchers, so head to WP1 and protect our launchers against enemy jets before they take them out. The 1st launcher is at WP1, and the 4th launcher site is at WP2.

Once the SAMs are down, return to Nalchik and get ready for the final assault on Mineralnye Vody.

**Mission 9**

*Final assault on the ALF, capture Mineralnye Vody.*

Mineralnye Vody is weakened, and a fortified base command (Fig 1) stands between the ALF and total annihilation. We have established a FOB outside of Mineralnye Vody airbase and have begun our assault. However, enemy forces are much stronger than we have anticipated and are threatening to take down our FOB.

Take out the 8 enemy command buildings at Mineralnye Vody airbase to prevent them from calling in more reinforcements. You should engage other targets of opportunity to protect our FOB and RTB to rearm and refuel if required, but don't let the ALF overwhelm our FOB.

Also, be prepared for enemy jets taking off from Mineralnye Vody.
